## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is an open-source tool developers install locally to manage source code, while GitHub is an online service to which developers who use Git can connect and upload or download resources.
3. Why do we create a branch?
to maintain stability while isolated changes are made to code.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
to let others know about the changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
git checkout
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch is the command that tells your local git to retrieve the latest meta-data info from the original 

git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.

git pull on the other hand does that AND brings (copy) those changes from the remote repository
7. What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
Edit the conflicted file to resolve it.
